FluidCurrency is a Go utility to fetch currencies, crypto-currencies and precious metal exchange rates. It does come with a number of providers (see below) for maximum flexibility. This library provides a minimalist API and a default provider. Some developers need a high frequency rate, others only a limited of currencies. Check the providers comparison table and pick the one that bests suits you.
